        My name is Alastair Cleve, and I am a software developer. I have worked on
        applications in Rails, ASP.NET, JavaScript, React.js, and more. These days,
        I primarily develop in <b>C#</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>SQL</b>. I have
        an instatiable appetite for learning: I love acquiring new languages and skills.
        Towards that end, take a look at the <b>"Read Me"</b> section of this site,
        which contains articles that I have written on a variety of topics, from
        <b>LINQ Queries</b> to an overview of <b>how to mimic JavaScript's array mapping
        in C#</b>. This website was largely created so that I could share them with
        a wider audience. I have <b>many more articles to upload</b>, so check back often
        to read more.

        <br/><br/>I love working with curious people to come up with creative solutions
        to challenging problems. I enjoy manipulating and modeling data, and I like
        applying new techniques to things that I am currently working on. I tend to
        gravitate towards enterprise problems, since my background is in finance and law,
        which makes me well-placed to understand the problems that fintech and legal
        tech firms are trying to solve. However, if you have an interesting problem--in any
        industry--, feel free to <b>"Contact Me"</b> above.
