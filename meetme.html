        My name is Alastair Cleve, and I am a software developer. I have worked on
        applications in Rails, ASP.NET, JavaScript, React.js, and more. These days,
        I primarily develop in <b>C#</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>SQL</b>. I have
        an instatiable appetite for learning: I love acquiring new languages and skills.
        Towards that end, take a look at the <b>"Read Me"</b> section of this site,
        which contains articles that I have written on a variety of topics, from
        <b>TypeScript</b> to an overview of <b>asynchronous programming in .NET</b>.
        This website was largely created so that I could share them with a wider audience.

        <br/><br/>I enjoy working with and modeling data, and I love applying new
        techniques to things that I am currently working on. My background is in
        finance and law, so I am well-placed to understand the problems that fintech
        and legal tech firms are trying to solve. If you have an interesting problem,
        feel free to <b>"Contact Me"</b> above.
