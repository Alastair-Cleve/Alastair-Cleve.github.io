    <div class="article-title">Using Enums as Bit Flags</div>

    <p>
      C#, like other programming languages such as C++ and Java, exposes an enumeration
      type--often referred to as an <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>. An
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> is a distinct type that consists
      of constants which map to an underlying type. This enables developers to give
      meaningful names to different codes. For example, suppose we are dealing with
      a deck of cards. We might have an <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> for Suits:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      public enum Suits {
        Spades,
        Clubs,
        Diamonds,
        Hearts
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now imagine that we have a card class, and one of the properties of that class
      is a <code class="language-csharp">Suit</code> property. We declare that
      property as a <code class="language-csharp">Suits</code> type so that we
      can set it to a value in the <code class="language-csharp">Suits</code>
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suit = Suits.Spades;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the database, this value will be stored as <b>0</b>, since an enum in C# maps
      to an <code class="language-csharp">int</code> by default and since that mapping
      begins at <b>0</b> by default. If we had wanted to start the enumeration at
      a different integer, we could have:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      public enum Suits {
        Spades = 6,
        Clubs = 7,
        Diamonds = 12,
        Hearts = 34
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>Primary Benefits</u>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can map the enumerator list to whatever integers make the most sense for our
      application. Further, we can map to a different data type, such as
      <code class="language-csharp">byte</code> or <code class="language-csharp">long</code>,
      provided that they are supported types. However, for most cases,
      <code class="language-csharp">int</code> is most useful.
      Using <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s is extremely helpful because
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suit = Suits.Spades;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      is far more readable than
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suit = 6;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, we get support from IntelliSense, which provides the possible
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> values as we are writing, and
      we get some additional type safety, since we cannot set a property to a
      value that does not exist in the enumerator list, i.e.
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suit = 99;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      will produce an error. Finally, it enables storage of a code in the database as
      opposed to some unwieldy string. When a row is read from the database, the
      <code class="language-csharp">int</code> (or <code class="language-csharp">byte</code>
      or <code class="language-csharp">long</code>, etc., as the case may be) is cast
      to the enum and then set to the appropriate property. The developer does not
      need to think about any underlying codes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>Bit Flags</u>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have worked with <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s before,
      you may have noticed that something I just said is only partially true:
      additional type safety. While it is true that you cannot assign an integer to a
      property typed as an <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>
      that is not in the enumerated list, you can cast any integer to the
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> and then assign it. For example,
      this will produce an error:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suit = 99;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This will not produce an error:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suit = (Suits)99;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you interrogate the result of the second assignment, you will discover
      that the <code class="language-csharp">Suit</code> property on the card
      object is now set to 99, and there are neither compile errors nor
      runtime errors. But, why should <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s allow this?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer lies in a powerful feature of <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s
      known as bit flags. By performing bitwise operations on the <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>,
      you can set a property to the result of that operation and then interrogate that
      property to determine whether it includes one of the constants in the
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>. Let’s explore this more by looking
      at the <code class="language-csharp">[Flags]</code> decorator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enums can be marked with the <code class="language-csharp">[Flags]</code>
      decorator, which does one thing: it alters that <code class="language-csharp">ToString()</code>
      method so that it returns a string that is the concatenation of
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> values. It does not enable bitwise
      operations—any <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> in C# supports such operations.
      However, since it overrides the <code class="language-csharp">ToString()</code>
      method, it is often used in conjunction with <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s as
      bit flags. For example, suppose we have another Suits <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>,
      although this one is called <code class="language-csharp">SuitsFlags</code>:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      [Flags]
      public enum SuitsFlags {
        Spades = 1,
        Clubs = 2,
        Diamonds = 4,
        Hearts = 8
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine that we have special cards in our deck that have a <code class="language-csharp">Suits</code>
      property, which allows them to have more than one suit. When setting that
      property, we use a bitwise <b>OR</b> operator. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      card.Suits = SuitsFlags.Spades | SuitsFlags.Clubs;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Suits property on this object has now been set to two values,
      <code class="language-csharp">Spades</code> and <code class="language-csharp">Clubs</code>.
      The <code class="language-csharp">[Flags]</code> attribute means that when we
      make a call to <code class="language-csharp">ToString()</code>, a string of
      the concatenated names is returned: “Spades, Clubs.”
    </p>

    <p>
      While this <code class="language-csharp">ToString()</code> functionality is
      nice, what is really powerful about using <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s
      as flags is that we can later test for one of these values and perform any
      appropriate logic, e.g.:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      if (card.Suits.HasFlag(SuitsFlags.Spades)) {
        // Do something
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you may be asking: why does this work? The answer lies in the values of
      the <code class="language-csharp">SuitsFlag</code> enumeration list.
      In binary, these values are:
    </p>

    <p>
      <table class="binary">
        <tr>
          <td>Spades</td>
          <td><b>0001</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Clubs</td>
          <td><b>0010</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Diamonds</td>
          <td><b>0100</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hearts</td>
          <td><b>1000</b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      When you perform a bitwise <b>OR</b> operation on these values, it is sort
      of like adding them together:
    </p>

    <p>
      <table class="binary">
        <tr>
          <td>Spades</td>
          <td><b>0001</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Clubs</td>
          <td><b><u>0010</u></b></td>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td><b>0011</b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      You will notice that the resulting value of this operation—<b>0011</b> or <b>3</b>—does not
      exist in the <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>, yet we were still able
      to set <code class="language-csharp">card.Suits</code> to it. This is desirable,
      since it allows us to test for the inclusion of a particular flag, as we did
      above with the call to <code class="language-csharp">HasFlag()</code>. In essence,
      all <code class="language-csharp">HasFlag()</code> is doing is performing a bitwise
      <b>AND</b> operation, i.e.
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      if (card.Suits.HasFlag(SuitsFlags.Spades) { … }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      is equivalent to:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      if ((card.Suits & Suits.Spades) == Suits.Spades) { … }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This works because the <b>AND</b> operator will produce the result of the
      sought <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> property.
    </p>

    <p>
      <table class="binary">
        <tr>
          <td>card.Suits</td>
          <td><b>0011</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>SuitsFlags.Spades</td>
          <td><b><u>0001</u></b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td><b>0001</b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Only the first bit for both the <code class="language-csharp">card.Suits</code>
      property and <code class="language-csharp">SuitsFlags.Spades</code>
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> is <b>1</b>, so the result is
      <b>0001</b>, which is the values of <code class="language-csharp">SuitsFlags.Spades</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this only works because we set the values of the
      <code class="language-csharp">SuitsFlags</code>
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> to powers of 2 so that only one
      bit will be <b>1</b>. To make this even clearer, we could have written the
      <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> with the left-shift operator as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      [Flags]
      public enum SuitsFlags {
        Spades = 1 << 0,
        Clubs = 1 << 1,
        Diamonds = 1 << 2,
        Hearts = 1 << 3
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, this only works because the enumeration type allows you to set
      the underlying value of a property to a value that is not in the enumeration list.
      If you could not do this, then you would have to list every combination of flags
      as a separate entry in the enum, which would be very tedious and error-prone. The
      total number of combinations could be as high as the <b>sum of r = 1 => n of n!/(r!(n-r)!)</b>, where
      <b>n</b> is the total number of entries in the enumerator list and <b>r</b> the number of entries
      taken at a time. For an <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> of 4 entries, this would
      be 15 combinations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an ideal world, these two functionalities of <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s
      —using the <code class="language-csharp">enum</code> to represent a single value
      from a list and using <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>s as flags—would
      be broken into two different types. One type could be an <code class="language-csharp">enum</code>
      which would provide the former functionality and also strictly limit any property values
      to those that are included in the enumeration list. The second type could be called a
      bit flag or a bit array and would allow a property to be set to the result of
      bitwise operations, i.e. values that are not in the list.
