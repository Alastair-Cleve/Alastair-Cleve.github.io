    <div class="article-title">Language-Integrated Queries (LINQ) in C#</div>

    <p>
      LINQ queries provide a consistent model for working with data across various kinds
      of data sources and formats. Rather than having to learn a new domain-specific query
      language for each data source (e.g., SQL for relational databases, XQuery for XML, &c.),
      LINQ provides a single interface for querying across data sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      LINQ queries are especially useful for working with C# collections, such as
      <code class="language-csharp">Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> and
      <code class="language-csharp">List&lt;T&gt;</code>. In a LINQ query, you obtain the data source,
      create the query, and execute the query:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      // 1. Obtain the data source.
      int[] numbers = new int[7] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      // 2. Create the query.
      IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; numQuery =
        from num in numbers
        where (num % 2) == 0
        select num;
      </code></pre>

      Or (using the <code class="language-csharp">var</code> keyword):

      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var numQuery =
        from num in numbers
        where (num % 2) == 0
        select num;
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      // 3. Execute the query.
      foreach (int num in numQuery) {
            …
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <b>Query Execution</b>

    <p>
      Note that in LINQ, the query variable (numQuery above) itself takes no action and returns no data.
      A query is not executed until the foreach loop. Accordingly, LINQ queries can only be applied on
      data sources that support the <code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface
      (e.g., generic collection classes, such as <code class="language-csharp">List&lt;T&gt;</code>).
      Types that support <code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> or the derived
      <code class="language-csharp">IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface are called <i>queryable</i> types.
      Note also that non-generic collection classes, such as <code class="language-csharp">ArrayList</code>,
      which support <code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable</code>, can also be queried with LINQ.
    </p>

    <p>
      A queryable type requires no modification or special treatment to serve as a LINQ data source. If the
      source data is not already in memory as a queryable type, the LINQ provider must represent it as such,
      for example:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      using System.Xml.Linq;
      XElement contacts = XElement.Load(@"c:\myContactList.xml");
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <b>Execution Timing</b>

    <p>
      <u>Deferred</u> – the query is not immediately run, which means that the query stored
      in the query variable can be re-used as the data change:
      <ul><li class="article-li">foreach loop</li></ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>Immediate</u> – the query is immediately run. These methods rely on foreach; as a
      result, they force the query to be run.
      <ul>
        <li class="article-li">Count()</li>
        <li class="article-li">Max()</li>
        <li class="article-li">Average()</li>
        <li class="article-li">First()</li>
        <li class="article-li">ToList()</li>
        <li class="article-li">ToArray()</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Count, Max, Average, First, and other aggregation functions, a single value is
      returned, whereas in ToList and ToArray, the results of the query are cached in a
      local variable, e.g.:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      List&lt;int&gt; numQuery2 =
        (from num in numbers
         where (num % 2) == 0
         select num).ToList();
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <b>A Note on <code class="language-csharp">var</code></b>

    <p>
      In the example above, a query is written in two ways: <code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;</code>
      and <code class="language-csharp">var</code>. <code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;</code>
      just means that the query, when it is executed, will produce a sequence of zero or more integer objects.
      However, this query may also be written with <code class="language-csharp">var</code>, which instructs
      the compiler to infer the type of a query variable by looking at the data source specified in the from clause.
      The <code class="language-csharp">var</code> keyword is useful when the type of the variable is obvious or
      when it is not that important to explicitly specify nested generic types such as those that are produced
      by group queries. In general, MSDN recommends that if you use <code class="language-csharp">var</code>,
      you should realize that it can make your code more difficult for others to read.
    </p>

    <b>Grouping</b>

    <p>
      LINQ supports many SQL-like methods, such as joining and grouping, which produces a list of lists:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var custQuery =
        from cust in customers
        group cust by cust.City into custGroup
        where custGroup.Count() > 2
        orderby custGroup.Key
        select custGroup;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that custQuery is an <code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;IGrouping&lt;string, Customer&gt;&gt;</code>,
      and since it is a list of lists, it requires a nested loop:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      foreach (var customerGroup in custQuery) {
        Console.WriteLine(customerGroup.Key);
        foreach (Customer customer in customerGroup) {
          Console.WriteLine("    {0}", customer.Name);
        }
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <b>Data Transformations</b>

    <p>
      In addition to retrieving data, LINQ can be used to transform data. By using a LINQ query, you can
      use a source sequence as input and modify it in many ways to create a new output sequence. You can
      modify the sequence itself without modifying the elements themselves by sorting and grouping. But the
      most powerful feature of LINQ queries is the ability to create new types.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, in this query, we get a list of teachers and students who live in Seattle, even though
      teachers and students are separate classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var peopleInSeattle =
        (from student in students
         where student.City == "Seattle"
         select student.Last)
            .Concat(from teacher in teachers
                    where teacher.City == "Seattle"
                    select teacher.Last);
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also select an output that is entirely different from the input:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      double[] radii = { 1, 2, 3 };
      IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; query =
        from rad in radii
        select String.Format("Area = {0}", (rad * rad) * 3.14);
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <b>Selecting More Than 1 Property</b>

    <p>
      With LINQ, you can easily select 1 property:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var query =
        from cust in Customers
        select cust.City;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also select the entire object:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var query =
        from cust in Customers
        select cust;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, you can select more than 1 property but less than the entire object:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var query =
        from cust in Customer
        select new { Name = cust.Name, City = cust.City };
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This can be very powerful, especially when combined with a join operation:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      var innerJoinQuery =
        from cust in customers
        join dist in distributors on cust.City equals dist.City
        select new { CustomerName = cust.Name, DistributorName = dist.Name };
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that because the select statement produces an anonymous type, the query variable must be
      implicitly typed by using <code class="language-csharp">var</code> and because the type of the
      query variable is implicit, the iteration variable in the foreach loop must also be implicit.
    </p>

    <b>Query Syntax v. Method Syntax</b>

    <p>
      Because declarative query syntax must be translated into method calls for the .NET common language
      runtime (CLR), you have the option of using method syntax directly. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      // Query Syntax

      IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; numQuery1 =
        from num in numbers
        where num % 2 == 0
        orderby num
        select num;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      // Method Syntax

      IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; numQuery2 =
        numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).OrderBy(num => num);
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in C#, <code class="language-csharp">=></code> is the lambda operator, which is read as
      “goes to”. The num on the left of the operator is the input variable which corresponds to num in
      the query expression, and the "return value" is just the expression result.
    </p>
