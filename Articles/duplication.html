    <div class="article-title">Shallow & Deep Duplication in C#</div>

    <p>
      C# provides a <code class="language-csharp">MemberwiseClone()</code> method, which creates a shallow copy
      of a given object by creating a new object, and then copying the nonstatic fields of the current object
      to the new object. If a field is a value type (i.e., it stores its own data)<a href="#" onclick="utils.scrollToBottom()">[1]</a>,
      then a bit-by-bit copy of the field is performed. However, if a field is a reference type (i.e., it holds
      a pointer to data elsewhere)<a href="#" onclick="utils.scrollToBottom()">[2]</a>, the reference is copied
      but the referred object is not; therefore, the original object and its clone refer to the same
      object.<a href="#" onclick="utils.scrollToBottom()">[3]</a> Consider the following example:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      public class Person {
        public int Age;
        public string Name;
        public IdInfo IdInfo;

        public Person ShallowCopy() {
          return (Person)this.MemberwiseClone();
        }
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, Age is copied, whereas only the references to Name and IdInfo are copied. In order to copy all
      referred objects and not just references, a custom method must be created. Consider the following:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      public static T DeepClone&lt;T&gt;(T obj) {
        using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream()) {

          BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
          formatter.Serialize(memoryStream, obj);
          memoryStream.Position = 0;

          return (T)formatter.Deserialize(memoryStream);
        }
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This method creates a <u>deep</u> copy of an object by serializing an object into binary on a memory
      stream and then de-serializing the stream into an object graph, which is then casted into the
      specified object type. The <code class="language-csharp">using</code> statement is required
      because <code class="language-csharp">MemoryStream</code> implements
      <code class="language-csharp">IDisposable</code>, which requires that it be disposed after use.
      The <code class="language-csharp">using</code> statement is syntactic sugar for calling
      <code class="language-csharp">Dispose()</code> in a <code class="language-csharp">try...catch</code>
      block.

      Thus, calling
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      Person person1 = new Person();
      Person person2 = DeepClone&lt;Person&gt;(person1);
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      creates two identical, but separate in memory, Person objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the price that is paid for this method is slow speed, since the entire object is converted
      into binary and then re-converted back. However, it does ensure a full, separate copy. If speed is a
      concern, consider creating a method on the class in question which provides deep duplication.
      For example, the Person class above could implement:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code class="language-csharp">
      public Person DeepCopy() {
        Person other = (Person)this.MemberwiseClone();
        other.IdInfo = new IdInfo(IdInfo.IdNumber);
        other.Name = String.Copy(Name);
        return other;
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this uses the <code class="language-csharp">MemberwiseClone()</code> method and then creates
      copies of IdInfo and Name, since those are reference types. The benefit of this approach is that
      it is faster; however, the penalty is that you must catch for reference types.

        [1] Value types include: all numeric data types, Boolean, Char, Date, all Structs (even if their
        members are reference types), and Enumerations (since their underlying type is always SByte,
        Short, Integer, Long, Byte, UShort, UInteger, or ULong)
      <p>

      <p>
        [2] Reference types include: String, Array (even if its elements are value types), Class types,
        and Delegates
      </p>

      <p>
        [3] To test whether an object is a Value type or Reference Type, consider using: is ValueType. Ex:
        <p>
          <pre><code class="language-csharp">
          int i = 3;
          if (i is ValueType) {
               // Do stuff
          }
          </code></pre>
